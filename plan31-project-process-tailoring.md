## 1. Tailored Process Elements

| Standard Process Asset | Customization Applied               | Rationale                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Requirements Analysis  | Use GitHub Issues for requirement tracking | Lightweight, traceable, team-friendly      |
| Design Reviews         | Peer review via GitHub pull requests | Simple, integrated into daily workflow     |
| Commit Guidelines      | Use semantic commits with issue tags | Enables traceability and better summaries  |
| QA Testing             | Manual + Postman API tests only      | Small team, short timeline constraints     |
