# Project Development Approach (PLAN21)

This document describes the selected project management methodology and the rationale behind its adoption for the Reservify platform.

## Chosen Lifecycle Method: Hybrid Custom

Reservify is a dynamic, feature-driven web-based application targeting small businesses. We chose a **hybrid custom** approach for the following reasons:

- Combines structured planning (from Waterfall) with adaptive iterations (from Agile/Scrum)
- Allows early design and architecture decisions while retaining flexibility for frontend/backend iterations
- Fits the needs of a 3-person team with shared responsibilities and changing roles

## Lifecycle Methods Compared

| Lifecycle Name | Description             | When to Use It?       |
|----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Waterfall      | Linear, sequential      | Fixed-scope contracts  |
| Scrum          | Agile, sprint-based     | Teams with daily standups and scrum roles |
| Hybrid Custom  | Mix of waterfall & agile| Projects requiring both planning and flexibility |

## Summary

The hybrid approach supports effective planning while allowing continuous feedback, quick iterations, and adaptive problem solving.
