## 1. Historical Data Reference

| Project | Requirements | DB Tables | Modules | Team Size | Total Effort (hrs) |
|---------|--------------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| PRJ01   | 50           | 60        | 8       | 5         | 80                  |
| PRJ02   | 80           | 45        | 5       | 9         | 120                 |
| PRJ03   | 65           | 52        | 6       | 7         | 100                 |

- These benchmarks helped us size modules and estimate timeline for Reservify based on similar scope.
