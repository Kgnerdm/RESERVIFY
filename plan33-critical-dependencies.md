## 1. Task Dependency Map

| Predecessor Activity     | Successor Activity         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Requirements Finalization| UI Design                  |
| UI Design                | Frontend Development       |
| Backend Architecture     | API Implementation         |
| API Implementation       | Module Integration         |
| Module Integration       | Final Testing              |

## 2. Critical Path Activities

| Critical Activity         | Justification                                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Requirements Finalization | Core foundation for all design and development     |
| UI Design                 | Directly affects development start time            |
| API Implementation        | Key enabler for both frontend and testing phases   |
| Integration & Testing     | Final validation stage before delivery             |

## 3. Risk Handling Strategy

- Schedule buffers added after each critical task.
- Weekly progress meetings to monitor these dependencies.
- Commit tags linked to Issues for traceability.
